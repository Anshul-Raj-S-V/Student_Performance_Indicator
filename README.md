## Project Overview üìù

  The Student Performance Indicator predicts student academic outcomes based on historical data, providing insights for both educators and students. It leverages Machine Learning models such as CatBoost& XGBoost         for accurate predictions and uses a Flask web interface to make it interactive and easy to use.
  By analyzing factors like gender, race, parental education, test preparation, and previous scores, the tool helps:
    1.Students identify strengths and areas for improvement
    2.Educators provide targeted guidance
    3.Schools make data-driven decisions

    
## Features ‚ö°

  1.Predict student performance using ML models
  2.Input form via Flask web interface
  3.Interactive results display on the web page
  4.Scalable and deployable with Docker
  5.Supports CSV-based batch predictions (extendable)
  6.Clean, modular code structure using Python packages
